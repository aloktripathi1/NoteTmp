## 🎨 Customization

### Theme Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `src/index.css` to customize the color scheme:

```css
:root {
  --paper: 42 40% 97%;      /* Background color */
  --ink: 30 15% 18%;        /* Text color */
  --glow: 25 80% 55%;       /* Accent color */
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Default Settings
Modify defaults in `src/hooks/useSettings.ts`:

```typescript
const DEFAULT_SETTINGS = {
  fontSize: 15,      // Default font size
  tabSize: 4,        // Default tab width (wider!)
  lineHeight: 1.7,   // Default line height
};
```

## 📝 Tips

1. **Focus Mode**: The interface fades away as you type, keeping you focused
2. **Keyboard First**: Most actions have keyboard shortcuts for faster workflow
3. **Auto-Save**: Your work is saved automatically - no manual save needed
4. **Persistent by Default**: Notes stay saved locally until you clear them
